* Date				User				Description
* 2026-09-28		claude (draft)		Khởi tạo từ LLD Datamart/lld/QLQ/DTM_QLQ_investment_fund_dim_FMS_FUNDS.csv
* 2026-10-07		claude (sync)		Đồng bộ LLD theo Atomic FMS UAT 20261006 (commit 117654ae, 53443cc1): đọc ticker_symbol, cl_fms_fund_tp_code, cl_fms_status_code;
*                                       BỎ fund_tp_decision_nbr, fund_tp_par_val_description, fund_tp_identifier_description, stock_exchange_nm (schema-changing)
* 2026-10-10		claude				total_outstanding_unit_quantity, initial_offering_unit_quantity int -> bigint theo LLD sửa 2026-10-08 (commit 216a6491, tránh tràn số âm) (schema-changing:
*                                       Iceberg cần ALTER COLUMN ... TYPE bigint trên bảng chính + _hstr trước khi chạy)
* 2026-10-24		claude (sync)		Đồng bộ LLD commit 576f001c (luật A23 PK Dim): investment_fund_id lấy trực tiếp investment_fund.investment_fund_id (Atomic) thay cho
*                                       generate_surrogate_key_bigint — khớp FK investment_fund_id mà các model khác đọc từ Atomic (logic-only, schema không đổi)
