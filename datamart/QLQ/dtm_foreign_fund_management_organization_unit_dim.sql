* 2026-09-28		claude (draft)		Khởi tạo từ LLD Datamart/lld/QLQ/DTM_QLQ_foreign_fund_management_organization_unit_dim_FMS_FOR_BRCH.csv
*                                       LLD atomic_table =  Ref sang atm_foreign_fund_management_organization_unit (scd4a,
*                                       alias foreign_fund_management_organization_unitcùng cột foreign_fm_ou_*) vì atm_foreign_fm_ou
*                                       không khai trong schema_atm_involved_party.yml (rơi về default incremental/appendkhông có _hstr).
* 2026-10-07		claude (sync)		Đồng bộ LLD theo Atomic FMS UAT 20261006 (commit 117654ae, 53443cc1): đọc ou_tp_code, cl_fms_status_code,
*                                       cl_fms_event_tp_id/code, parent_ou_nm/code (tên cột Datamart giữ nguyên)
* 2026-10-24		claude (sync)		Đồng bộ LLD commit 576f001c (luật A23 PK Dim): foreign_fund_management_organization_unit_id lấy trực tiếp foreign_fm_ou.foreign_fm_ou_id (Atomic) thay cho
*                                       generate_surrogate_key_bigint — khớp FK foreign_fund_management_organization_unit_id mà các model khác đọc từ Atomic (logic-only, schema không đổi)
